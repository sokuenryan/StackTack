# Why Did You Build StackTack?
Ever seen something like this? <br>

"You have been charged with $30 late payment fee" <br>
"You have 1 week to pay your electric bill before we shut off your electricity." <br>
"You have 1 week til your premium free trial ends, to which your new bill will be $50.00/Month" <br>

Now you have to log into these apps every time you need to check a bill date. 
  - Your banking app
  - Your credit card apps
  - your electric bill app
  - your wifi carrier app <br>
Why do that when I can just build an app that stops me from logging into every app just to check the due date. 

# Monthly Bill Due Dates
I moved apartments once and so I had to switch WIFI carriers. Usually if my bill is late by a day or so I get a warning. My new carrier gives me near $10 fee for late payment! 

I have a whiteboard in my room that shows all my bills, I have them on my phone's notebook app, and I have a hardcopy calendar planner. As I was adding stuff to my Google Calendar I realized StackTack calendar could free up space, due to it's specfificity on bill tracking, it would also make it easier to remain organized. 

I got to thinking...what else should StackTack do?

# Tracking Investments
Got a new big purchase you are financing? Or maybe you want to hit a certain amount in your savings account, but either way, you can add it to the investment area of the app and even track you contributions towards it. 
(added a little popup message as well when you reach full payment ^_^) 

# Paying Credit on Time
Oh boy. The dreaded credit score aspect of adulthood. Well, now it's easier as you can list out all your credit cards (hopefully you don't have too many) and all the credit amounts for both revolving credit and loans as well. 
This correlates directly with the "Add Bill" portion of the app as you can see on the react-calendar the day all your credit bills are due! 

# Conclusion
Honestly this beats logging into your 2-3 banking apps, your subscription apps, and your weekly home bill apps for wifi and electricity. If you are old school you carry around a hardcopy planner, but if you forget. StackTack is here to save the day!
