# Welcome to StackTack!!
## Overview
StackTack is a financial management application built with React.js.<br>
It helps users effectively manage their financial bill tracking, monitor due dates, and contributions made towards their credit and investment goals using an easy, clean, and simplistic visual interface.<br> 

## Inspiration
The app's inspiration came about as a showcase for a problem solving solution when I realized it would be much easier to log into one app instead of many when needing to check my financial due dates.<br>
When moving my financial apps to one area of my phone for ease of access I realized I had to sign into more than one. 

## StackTack's Benefit to My Life
This app not only has helped me stay on time with credit due dates increasing my credit, but also has become a synergetic tool when budgeting and calculating my finances for the week allowing me to easily see where I need to cut or contribute spending.

# Planned Upcoming Features
## Backend Work
At the moment all user data gets saved to the local storage.<br>
### Note <br>
***All data input areas are intended for ***basic info only*** and **NOT** for the user to create or generate ANY sensative or confidential information***<br>
However, backend is needed so that muliple users ***can*** use the application on more than one browser 
due to the fact that it's client-side only at the moment. The app is intended for personal use, but for 
cleanliness and proficiency for the app a small storage working the non-complex data would make this app 
both clean of duplication and feel more complete.
