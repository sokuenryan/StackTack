# Bill Tracker App

The idea behind this app was to make it so every time you had to check a bill's due date you didn't have to log into every app. 

Adultiing is hard enough without having to log into 3-8 different to check your bills every other week. 
You know that email they send when your electric bill is past due, or your phone lost all it's high speed data and now you are loggin in to check when the bill is due.
I even got a fee once for not paying my internet bill on time, where as my old wifi company didn't. 

Needless to say I had a specific folder on my phone that contains ALL my login areas for bills. So I thought to myself. What if I had one app that could track everything? 

StackTack doesn't only help you trackbills. I wanted to add some spice so I added a few extra features. 

# Tracking Investments
Got a new big purchase you are financing? Or maybe you want to hit a certain amount in your savings account, but either way, you can add it to the investment area of the app and even track you contributions towards it. 
(added a little popup message as well when you reach full payment ^_^) 

# Paying Credit on Time
Oh boy. The dreaded credit score aspect of adulthood. Well, now it's easier as you can list out all your credit cards (hopefully you don't have too many) and all the credit amounts for both revolving credit and loans as well. 
This correlates directly with the "Add Bill" portion of the app as you can see on the react-calendar the day all your credit bills are due! 

Honestly this beats logging into your 2-3 banking apps, your subscription apps, and your weekly home bill apps for wifi and electricity. If you are old school you carry around a hardcopy planner, but if you forget. StackTack is here to save the day!
