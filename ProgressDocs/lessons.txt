    LESSON:
    - Don't change the repo name. It overcomplicates things.
    
    LESSON: Sometimes it's better to FETCH data than PASS DATA. 
    The first idea was to pass the data from one child component up to the parent 
    component and then once updated in the parent component, pass it down to a
    different child component.
    
    - Making the child components independant of other components seems to make data 
    functionality WAYYYYY easier to work with. 
    - It also decreases the chance of needing to fix anything at all. 
    - Almost seems like a regular family. Componets need to be independant but also 
    simultaneously co-existant with other components. Hyper-dependant components seem 
    to make things very messy. 
    
    
    Had a lengthy phone conversation and had to make up the time at home. 
    Spend more time on your code today so you don't have later. 
    Remember,you got this. Stay on track. You have not far to go. 
    Believe and Perservere.
        - past Zee. :)

    NOTE:
    - AI is programmed to act like it knows what it's talking about, and after
    several conversations it kept asking me to check and double check different parts 
    of my code to make sure it was working properly which it should've been but it
    wasn't. 

    Notes: 
    - You have to input your own styles in first, and THEN you can import the 
    node_modules after. I beleive that's why it worked before. 
    - Copying and pasting seemed to keep making me mess up classNames in the code. 
    - Deleting certain things in huge chunks isn't good as much of the code is linked
     to other parts that make it function and this tends to create bugs quite quickly.
