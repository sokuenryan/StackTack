Plans Draft: 
    - create a new tab in investments and credit for
    1- "existing investments" 
    2- "credit lines"

    - Have an a-tag link set up in your listed items sends you directly to the
    page of the specific listed investment or credit line. 

    - Have the new tab list out all of them and have those listed items also
    have an a tag that lists all the other lists. 

    - When a list is clicked it brings removes all the data seen on that tab 
    and shows the list, but it also has a back button that works exactly like 
    the homepage. 

New Plan: 
    Due to some discoveries made while coding I came up with the UI UX design for the Credit and Investment
    tabs. 

    -- ADDING MAIN DATA--
        - BOTH the credit and investment "Create New ____" are going to remain
        the same. You will add the name and the amount. 
    status: Complete

    --PRINTING OUT TO THE NEXT PAGE--
        - The "Existing _____" tab next to it will FETCH the data just like
         the Calendar component is Bills.jsx and display it just the same as 
         it is with the same styles as in the "Create New ____" tab. 

        - Every time you edit the name or the amount it will update as it pulls the data directly from the local storage. 
    status: Complete

    --CONTRIBUTION FEATURE--
        - You will hit the Contribution button and add a number that stores
        itself in the local storage and it will start at 0.00 and add 
        whatever you put in there. 

        - Once the new data is stored, The contribution button will keep 
        acting as an addition button to the data stored. 
    status: Complete

    --EDITING & DELETING--
        - Editing button will edit the data stored even if it's at the default of 0.00. It only will link to that, 
        and not the incrementing button. 

        - The delete feature will not be available on the "Existing ___" tabs but it will be available on the 
        "Create New ______" 

        - When you do hit delete tho it will delete everything including the data created on "Existing ___" in the 
        incrementor. 
    status: Complete

    --MATCHING THE DATA--
        - When the data from "Existing ___" and "Create New _____" MATCHING:
        a toastify message will pop up saying:"Congrats! Progress Complete!"
        or whatever you choose. 
    status: Complete

    --Optional-- 
        - it will set the "paid" checkmark to "true",but it still will be able
         to be toggled. 
        - Checklists incite the dopamine response so maybe this is not a 
        good idea and perhaps somewhat counter-intuitive. 

        - This way everything can stay on one line, use multiple tabs for 
        space and clean UI and better UX. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
