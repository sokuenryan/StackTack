NOTE:
   - AI is programmed to act like it knows what it's talking about, and 
   after several conversations it kept asking me to check and double check 
   different parts of my code to make sure it was working properly which it 
   should've been but it wasn't. 

NOTE: 
   - You have to input your own styles in first, and THEN you can import 
   the node_modules after. I beleive that's why it worked before. 
   - Copying and pasting seemed to keep making me mess up classNames in the 
   code. 
   - Deleting certain things in huge chunks isn't good as much of the code is 
   linked to other parts that make it function and this tends to create bugs quite quickly.
